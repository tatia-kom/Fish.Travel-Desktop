        <p>Fish.Travel ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://fish.travel/ website (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").</p>
        <p>First things first – your privacy is important to us. We know that’s what all these kinds of notices say, but we really mean it. You’ve placed your trust in us by using Fish.Travel services and we value that trust. That means we’re committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data you give us.</p>
        <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
        <p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible from https://fish.travel</p>

        <h3>Definitions</h3>

        <h5>Service</h5>

        <p>Service is the <a href="https://fish.travel/" target="_blank">https://fish.travel/</a> website operated by Fish.Travel</p>

        <h5>Personal Data</h5>

        <p>Personal Data means data about a living individual who can be identified from those data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession).</p>

        <h5>Personal Data</h5>

        <h5>Usage Data</h5>

        <p>Usage Data is data collected automatically either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).</p>

        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

        <p>The main reason we ask you for personal details is a very good one – it’s to help administer your online bookings, ensure you get the best service possible, and keep your information safe. We also use your personal data to contact you and inform you about our latest deals and special offers. There are other uses, too – if you’d like to find out what they are, keep reading for a more detailed explanation.</p>

        <h3>Use of Data</h3>

        <p>Fish.Travel uses the collected data for various purposes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain the Service</li>
            <li>To notify you about changes to our Service</li>
            <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Service when you choose to do so</li>
            <li>To provide customer care and support</li>
            <li>To provide analysis or valuable information so that we can improve the Service</li>
            <li>To monitor the usage of the Service</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent and address technical issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sharing with Third Parties</h3>

        <p>In certain circumstances, we’ll share your personal data with third parties.</p>
        <p>The Accommodations You Booked: This one’s pretty important for what we do! In order to complete your reservation, we transfer relevant reservation details to the accommodations you've booked. This can include your name, contact details, payment details, the names of guests traveling with you, and any preferences you specified when you made your booking. If you have a question about your reservation, we may contact the accommodation provider and ask them to handle your request. Unless payment is made during the booking process through the Fish.Travel website, we'll forward your credit card details to the booked accommodations for further handling (assuming you’ve provided us with those details during your booking process). In cases of reservation-related disputes, we may give the accommodation provider information about the reservation process as needed. This may include a copy of your reservation confirmation as proof that a reservation was actually made.</p>
        <p>Your Local Fish.Travel Office: In order to support the use of the Fish.Travel services, your details may be shared with subsidiaries of the Fish.Travel corporate family. To find out everything you need to know about the Fish.Travel corporate family, visit About Fish.Travel.</p>
        <p>Third-party Service Providers: We may use service providers to process your personal data on our behalf. This processing is for several purposes, including for example sending out marketing material. Third-party service providers are bound by confidentiality clauses and are not allowed to use your personal data for other purposes.</p>
        <p>Payment providers and (other) Financial Institutions: Fish.Travel may be working with third parties to process payments. It has partnered with Ingenico ePayments to process payments by credit card in certain countries. Visit https://www.ingenico.com/privacy-policy to understand how Ingenico ePayments handles your personal data as part of the payment process. When a chargeback is requested for your reservation by either you or by the holder of the credit card used to make your reservation, we may need to share certain reservation details with the payment service provider and the relevant financial institution to handle the chargeback. This may also include a copy of your reservation confirmation or the IP address used to make your reservation. We may share information with relevant financial institutions, if we consider it strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention purposes.</p>
        <p>Competent Authorities: We disclose personal data to law enforcement insofar as it is required by law or is strictly necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts and fraud. We may need to further disclose personal data to competent authorities to protect and defend our rights or properties, or the rights and properties of our business partners.</p>
        <p>Business Partners: We work with many business partners around the world. Some of these business partners distribute or advertise our services, as well as help our other business partners distribute and advertise their own travel-related services. These business partners may also include the Priceline corporate group, a group which includes Fish.Travel. This may mean that their services are integrated into our website/apps, they've been enabled to show you a customized advertisement, or the Fish.Travel online reservation services are integrated into their websites and/or apps.</p>
        <p>When you make a reservation on one of our business partners’ websites or apps, certain personal data that you give them will be forwarded to us. If customer service is provided by the business partner, Fish.</p>
